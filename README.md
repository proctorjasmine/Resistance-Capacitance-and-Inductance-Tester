# Resistance-Capacitance-and-Inductance-Tester

Designed and implemented a differential, single-slope, resettable integrator circuit on a soldered breadboard for component 
measurement. Using this circuit I then created a command-line interface for the microcontroller Tiva TM4C123GH6PM. This 
allows users to trigger resistance, capacitance, or inductance measurements of the conponent placed across the DUT ports
based on input. Programmed system control and data acquisition in C, utilized analog comparators and interrupts, 
demonstrating embedded systems proficiency and hardware-software integration.
